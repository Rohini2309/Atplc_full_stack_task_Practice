<h1><center>Blockchain</center></h1>
<h3><center>Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.<br> An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).<br> Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.</center></h2>
